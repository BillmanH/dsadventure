    <p>I build tools and infrastructure, from proof of concept to final delivery, that make sense of unorganized data and enable decision making. In my free time I work on a wide variety of DIY and tech projects. Iâ€™m always looking to engage more with the Seattle tech scene.</p>

    <p>As for me, I'm not using any of your data. Some areas of the site require a login, but that's just so that I can give you custom content. Except for Google Analytics data, I don't look at my users at all. </p>
