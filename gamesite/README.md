# Personal Jupyter Notebook Blog Page

Django app for my personal homepage and content management system. This allows you to save a jupyter notebook in HTML in the `notebook` folder and it will render on the page and in the menu. It will add a background image, and some other features to the notebook which is rendered as a `template`

[Here is a link to my website](http://williamjeffreyharding.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=hompage), you can see the individual notebooks that are added in the the notebooks folder. 

**Features**
* Show|Hide code button
* Business card at the bottom for Twitter and LinkedIn
* Background image
* Google Analytics
* Google Ads

**TODO** 
* notebook css sheet
* D3 embedded (as soon as jupyter labs supports it)
