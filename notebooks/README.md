# notebooks

__often times notebooks on GitHub don't load__ [Here is the link](http://williamjeffreyharding.com/blog/?article=Generating_a_Random_World_Map_in_Python.html&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=blogs) to some of those notebooks on my personal blog.  
All backend functions are developed in Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks `import` the actual modules used in the production code. The only difference is that the notebooks provide a REPL run-through of each function so that it can be examined and documented. 

## Stages of the world
* Geography - the creation of geological features and elevation.
* Cities and Nations - population, buildings and division into nation-states.
* Conflict - events and procedures that bring story to the world. 

### World Pickles
* worlds (and everything in them) are saved in `pickle` files (`p`)
actual user `world` objects are stored in `\pickles\` as `.pkl` rather than `p`
